        <h1>SCI-FI LABORATORY REMAKE (WIP)</h1>
        <h4>Remaking an old project to a higher standard.</h4><br>

          <p>
            I wasn't happy with how this project was left off so in my free time I am working on improving it.<br>
          
            I am using this as an oppurtunity to practice and improve my Hard-Surface Modelling.<br>
          </p>

              <strong>ART DIRECTION</strong><br>
              <br>
              <i>Inspiration</i><br>
              
              Typically, for my projects, they seem to be very modern in setting, or a couple of my projects from 1st and 2nd year were a bit more historical in setting, using castles and more gothic aesthetics, but because of 
              my strong interest in the franchise it really spearheaded my interest in Sci-Fi for this project. Other media such as DOOM, Dead Space, Star Trek and Doctor Who, drove me towards making the environment that I created 
              for this project.<br>

              The initial project idea was to create the exterior of a Human Colony on an alien planet, which had been inspired by the Alien Franchise, stretching from the Nostromo Space Ship in <i><strong>Alien</strong> (1979)</i>,  
              to Hadley's Hope on Acheron LV-426 in <i><strong>Aliens</strong> (1986)</i>, to Freya's Prospect on BG386 in<i><strong>Aliens vs. Predator</strong> (Rebellion Developments)</i> in 2010, and lastly to Sevastapol found in 
              <i><strong>Alien: Isolation</strong> (SEGA and Creative Assembly)</i> 2014. While I am not overly interested in most Sci-Fi genres, there is something about Alien that really grips me, the whole aesthetic of this franchise 
              really resonates with me.<br>
    
              <br>

              <i>Inspiration Board</i><br>


              <br>
              However due to the short amount of extra time I had to dedicate to this project I had to take my initial idea and condense it
              down to a more managable size given the time period. With this in mind I planned out all of the potential rooms that I could
              use and this allowed me to remove excess if needed, planning ahead to best suit the time frame that I had for the project.<br>
              Applicable for both Space and Dis lmfao.<br>

              Talking about references that helped me create what i did.<br>

              MIGHT MAKE THIS LIKE "FINAL TOUCHES" OR SOME SHIT.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Unity Implementation</strong><br>
              After finalising my 3D models I then exported everything and imported it into Unity.<br>
              I created a character controller and began to animate certain key points in the environment to help<br>
              the player keep moving and exploring as well as to keep them on edge while playing.<br>
              <br>
              To help introduce a control group to aid with telling how effective the Narrative elements were in<br>
              the project, I created a small pop up that would appear showing the player information about certain<br>
              objects if they were close to them and also looking in their direction.
              <br>

              <strong>SELF-REFLECTION</strong><br>
              
              <br>
              Areas that I believe that I did well on during the process of this project;<br>
                
              <br>
              <li class="bullet list">With all my projects, I always make the effort to try and learn a new style or technique to help develop my artistic skills within digital art. I was really happy that I was able
                to learn about some of the techniques used for pixel art creation and that I was able to apply them directly to my work! The Silhouette technique for my pixel art was directly applicable to my concept
                work in general as a whole.<br>
              </li><br>
              
              <li class="bullet list">Coming up with alternate solutions when initial ideas failed.
              </li><br>
        
              <li class="bullet list">Coming up with solutions to having radio silence from groupmates.
              </li><br>
            </p>
    
            <p>
              <br>
              These are some areas that I believe I could improve upon.<br>
    
              <br>
              <li class="bullet list">Starting off, my biggest issue was scope and figuring out a solid concept that I was going to pursue for my final renders. I knew almost instantly what genre I wanted, however I wasn't 
                sure what I wanted the environment to be. Initially I had been inspired by some of Aliens colony on other planets and also with the Calisto Protocol trailers recently releasing I started off way to large, wanting to 
                create a colony on a frozen planet.<br> Eventually this was narrowed down to a spaceship, then down to just a couple of rooms from a space ship, to finally just a lab. Concept work for the bridge and somewhere else was done.
                However I never had the time to do any of it. If I hadn't wanted to create a such a highly photorealistic environment, I might have been able to create a few rooms and corridors connecting them. However since I was trying
                to model as accurately and realistically as I could it ate up a lot of my time, time that I did not have since I had spent quite a long time narrowing down my initial scope.<br>
              </li><br>
    
              <li class="bullet list">Also Since, at the time, I wasn't a huge consumer of the Sci-Fi genre, I didn't quite understand what it was that I was trying to create. I had 
                taken a mixture of many different styles, from modern and futuristic sources for all of the models that I made. <br>
                The result of this is an environment that doesn't know what it's trying to be.<br>
